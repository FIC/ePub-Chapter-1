<h2>Viscous Fluid Flow</h2>
<p>By comparing Eq. 0-26) with Eqs. (1-13), (1-]4), (1-18), (1-19), and (1-21), 
we see that Eq. (1-26) can also be written as <img src="images/1-27.png"/>
</p>
<p>That is, each velocity derivative can be resolved into a strain rate plus an 
angular velocity. The angular velocity does not distort the element, so that 
only the strain rate will cause a viscous stress, a fact which is exploited in 
Chap. 2.</p>
<p>To summarize, we have shown that all the kinematic properties of 
Ô¨Çuid Ô¨Çow-acceleration, translation, angular velocity, rate of dilatation, and 
shear-strain rate-are directly related to the Ô¨Çuid velocity vector V = (u, ŒΩ, w). 
These relations are identical to the equivalent expressions from inÔ¨Ånitesi- 
mal solid mechanics, if (u, ŒΩ, w) are instead taken to be components of the 
displacement vector. This analogy between Ô¨Çuid and solid continuum me- 
chanics is sometimes used to produce the equations of motion of a viscous 
linear Ô¨Çuid as a direct carryover from the equations of linear (Hookean) elas- 
ticity, with which students are often more familiar.</p>

<h3>1-3.4 The Transport Properties of a Fluid</h3> 

<p>The three so-called transport properties are the coefÔ¨Åcients of viscosity, 
thermal conductivity, and diffusion, so named because of the relation they 
bear to movement, or transport, of momentum, heat, and mass, respec- 
tively. Thus it is now popular in the Ô¨Åeld of chemical engineering to refer to 
a viscous-Ô¨Çow study as a problem in momentum transport, giving pause to 
the casual reader. The idea is not without merit. Each of the three coefÔ¨Å- 
cients relates a Ô¨Çux or transport to the gradient of a property. Viscosity re- 
lates momentum Ô¨Çux to velocity gradient, thermal conductivity relates heat 
Ô¨Çux to temperature gradient, and the diffusion coefÔ¨Åcient relates mass trans- 
port to concentration gradient. Further, the mathematical properties of mo- 
mentum, heat, and mass-Ô¨Çux problems are often similar and sometimes 
genuinely analogous. The perfect analogy, when it exists, is so striking that 
Bird et al. (2001) have devoted an entire textbook to an exposition of analo- 
gies among this trinity of problems. We should note now that the analogy 
fails in multidimensional problems because heat and mass Ô¨Çux are vectors 
while momentum Ô¨Çux (stress) is a tensor. </p>
<h3>1-3.5 The CoefÔ¨Åcient of Viscosity </h3>
<p>The layperson knows from experience what viscosity means and associ- 
ates it with the ability of a Ô¨Çuid to Ô¨Çow freely. Heavy oil takes a long time to 
Ô¨Çow out of a can. Light oil Ô¨Çows out quickly. The disastrous Boston 
molasses-tank explosion of 1919 [see Shank (1954)] caused one of the 
slowest Ô¨Çoods in history. The idea of viscosity being proportional to time to 
Ô¨Çow has become accepted practice in the petroleum industry. Thus the mo- 
torist purchases oil with a viscosity labeled SAE 30. This means that 60 rn1 
of this oil at a speciÔ¨Åed temperature takes 30 s to run out of a 1.76-cm hole 
in the bottom of a cup. This experiment is convenient and reproducible for 
very viscous liquids such as oil, but the time to Ô¨Çow is not viscosity, any 
more than the speed of sound is the time it takes an echo to return from a 
mountainside. It is an intriguing fact that the Ô¨Çow of a viscous liquid out of 
the bottom of a cup is a difÔ¨Åcult problem for which no analytic solution ex-ists at present. </p>

<p>A more fundamental approach to viscosity shows that it is the property of a 
Ô¨Çuid which relates applied stress to the resulting strain rate. The general rela- 
tions are considered in Sec. 2-4. Here we consider a simple and widely 
used example of a Ô¨Çuid sheared between two plates, as in Fig. 1-15. This 
geometry is such that the shear stress œÑ xy must be constant throughout the 
Ô¨Çuid. The motion is in the x direction only and varies withThus there is only a single Ô¨Ånite strain rate in this Ô¨Çow: </p>
<img src="images/1-28.png"/> 
<p>If one performs this experiment, one Ô¨Ånds that, for all the common Ô¨Çuids, 
the applied shear is a unique function of the strain rate:</p>
<img src="images/1-29.png"/> 
<p>Since, for a given motion V of the upper plate, œÑ xy is constant, it follows 
that in these Ô¨Çuids Œµxy, and hence duldy, is constant, so that the resulting 
velocity proÔ¨Åle is linear across the plate, as sketched in Fig. 1-15. This is 
true regardless of the actual form of the functional relationship in Eq. (1-29). 
If the no-slip condition holds, the velocity proÔ¨Åle varies from zero at the 
lower wall to Vat the upper wall (Prob. 1-16 considers the case of a slip 
boundary condition). Repeated experiments with various values of œÑ xy will 
establish the functional relationship Eq. (1-29). For simplewater, oils, or gases, the relationship is linear or newtonian: </p>
<img src="images/1-291.png"/>
<p>or</p>
<img src="images/1-292.png"/>
<p>The quantity ¬µ, called the coefÔ¨Åcient of viscosity of a newtonian Ô¨Çuid, is 
what handbooks commonly quote when listing the viscosity of a Ô¨Çuid (see 
App. A). Actually, there is also a second coefÔ¨Åcient, Œª, related toexpansions, but it is rarely encountered in practice (see Sec. 2-4).</p>
<img src="images/1-30.png"/>
<p>Equation (1-30) shows that the dimensions of ¬µ are stress-time: N‚Ä¢s/m2 [or 
kg/(m‚Ä¢s)] in metric units and lbf‚Ä¢s/ft2 [or slugs/ft‚Ä¢s)] in English units. The con- 
version factor is!</p>
<h3>1 N¬∑ s/m¬≤ = 0.0208861bf¬∑ s/ft¬≤</h3>
<p>The coefÔ¨Åcient ¬µ is a thermodynamic property and varies with temperature 
and pressure. Data for common Ô¨Çuids are given in App. A. 
If the functional relationship in Eq. (1-29) is nonlinear, the Ô¨Çuid is said to be 
nonnewtonian. Some examples of nonnewtonian behavior are sketched in 
Fig. 1-16. Curves for true Ô¨Çuids, which cannot resist shear, must pass 
through the origin on a plot of œÑ vs. Œµ. Other substances, called yielding Ô¨Çu- 
ids, show a Ô¨Ånite stress at zero strain rate and are really part Ô¨Çuid and part 
solid. </p>
<p>The curve labeled pseudoplastic in Fig. 1-16 is said to be shear-thinning, 
since its slope (local viscosity) decreases with increasing stress. If the thin- 
ning effect is very strong, the Ô¨Çuid may be termed plastic, as shown. The 
opposite case of a shear-thickening Ô¨Çuid is usually called a dilatant Ô¨Çuid, as 
shown. </p>
<p>Also illustrated in Fig. 1-16 is a material with a Ô¨Ånite yield stress, followed 
by a linear curve at Ô¨Ånite strain rate. This idealized material, part solid and 
part Ô¨Çuid, is called a Bingham plastic and is commonly used in analytic in- 
vestigations of yielding materials under Ô¨Çow conditions. Yielding substances</p>
<p>No single functional relation ¬µ(T, p) really describes any large class of Ô¨Çu- 
ids, but reasonable accuracy (¬±20 percent) can be achieved by nondimen- 
sionalizing the data with respect to the critical point (Tc, Pc). This procedure 
is the so-called principle of corresponding states [Keenan (1941)], wherein 
the given property, here ¬µ/ ¬µe, is found to be roughly a function of T/Tc and 
PilŒ°c, the reduced temperature and pressure. </p>
<p>This principle is not justiÔ¨Åed on thermodynamic grounds but arises simply 
from dimensional analysis and experimental observation. Since changes 
occur very rapidly near the critical point, Tc and Pc are known only approxi- 
mately, and it is essentially impossible to measure ¬µc accurately. Appendix 
A contains a table of critical constants (Tc, Pc, ¬µc, kc) for common Ô¨Çuids, 
which should be regarded as best-Ô¨Åt values. </p>
<p>Figure 1-17 shows a recommended correlation of reduced viscosity ¬µ/ ¬µc 
vs. reduced temperature T/Tc and reduced pressure p/Pc' As stated, the ac- 
curacy for any given Ô¨Çuid is about ¬±20 percent. By examining this Ô¨Ågure, we 
can make the following general statements: </p>
<ol><li>The viscosity of liquids decreases rapidly with temperature.</li> 
<li>The viscosity of low-pressure (dilute) gases increases with tempera- 
ture. </li>
<li>The viscosity always increases with pressure. </li>
<li>Very poor accuracy obtains near the critical point.</li></ol> 
<p>Since Pc for most Ô¨Çuids is greater than 10 atm (App. A), typical gas Ô¨Çow 
problems are at low reducedlimit curve of Fig. 1-17. </p>
