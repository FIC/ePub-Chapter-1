<h2>Viscous Fluid Flow</h2>
<p>By comparing Eq. 0-26) with Eqs. (1-13), (1-]4), (1-18), (1-19), and (1-21), 
we see that Eq. (1-26) can also be written as <img src="assets/images/1-27.png"/>
</p>
<p>That is, each velocity derivative can be resolved into a strain rate plus an 
angular velocity. The angular velocity does not distort the element, so that 
only the strain rate will cause a viscous stress, a fact which is exploited in 
Chap. 2.</p>
<p>To summarize, we have shown that all the kinematic properties of
fluid flow-acceleration, translation, angular velocity, rate of dilatation, and
shear-strain rate-are directly related to the fluid velocity vector V = (u, ν, w).
These relations are identical to the equivalent expressions from infinitesimal
solid mechanics, if (u, ν, w) are instead taken to be components of the
displacement vector. This analogy between fluid and solid continuum mechanics
is sometimes used to produce the equations of motion of a viscous
linear fluid as a direct carryover from the equations of linear (Hookean) elasticity,
with which students are often more familiar.</p>

<h3>1-3.4 The Transport Properties of a Fluid</h3> 

<p>The three so-called transport properties are the coefficients of viscosity, thermal
conductivity, and diffusion, so named because of the relation they bear
to movement, or transport, of momentum, heat, and mass, respectively.
Thus it is now popular in the field of chemical engineering to refer to a
viscous-flow study as a problem in momentum transport, giving pause to
the casual reader. The idea is not without merit. Each of the three coefficients
relates a flux or transport to the gradient of a property. Viscosity relates
momentum flux to velocity gradient, thermal conductivity relates heat
flux to temperature gradient, and the diffusion coefficient relates mass transport
to concentration gradient. Further, the mathematical properties of momentum,
heat, and mass-flux problems are often similar and sometimes
genuinely analogous. The perfect analogy, when it exists, is so striking that
Bird et al. (2001) have devoted an entire textbook to an exposition of analogies
among this trinity of problems. We should note now that the analogy
fails in multidimensional problems because heat and mass flux are vectors
while momentum flux (stress) is a tensor.</p>

<h3>1-3.5 The Coefficient of Viscosity</h3>

<p>The layperson knows from experience what viscosity means and associates
it with the ability of a fluid to flow freely. Heavy oil takes a long time to flow
out of a can. Light oil flows out quickly. The disastrous Boston molassestank
explosion of 1919 [see Shank (1954)] caused one of the slowest floods
in history. The idea of viscosity being proportional to time to flow has become
accepted practice in the petroleum industry. Thus the motorist purchases
oil with a viscosity labeled SAE 30. This means that 60 rn1 of this oil
at a specified temperature takes 30 s to run out of a 1.76-cm hole in the bottom
of a cup. This experiment is convenient and reproducible for very viscous
liquids such as oil, but the time to flow is not viscosity, any more than
the speed of sound is the time it takes an echo to return from a mountainside.
It is an intriguing fact that the flow of a viscous liquid out of the bottom
of a cup is a difficult problem for which no analytic solution exists at present.</p>

<p>A more fundamental approach to viscosity shows that it is the property of a
fluid which relates applied stress to the resulting strain rate. The general relations
are considered in Sec. 2-4. Here we consider a simple and widely
used example of a fluid sheared between two plates, as in Fig. 1-15. This
geometry is such that the shear stress τ xy must be constant throughout the
fluid. The motion is in the x direction only and varies with y, u = u(y) only.
Thus there is only a single finite strain rate in this flow:</p>

<img src="assets/images/1-28.png"/> 

<p>If one performs this experiment, one finds that, for all the common fluids,
the applied shear is a unique function of the strain rate:</p>

<img src="assets/images/1-29.png"/> 

<p>Since, for a given motion V of the upper plate, τ xy is constant, it follows
that in these fluids εxy, and hence duldy, is constant, so that the resulting
velocity profile is linear across the plate, as sketched in Fig. 1-15. This is
true regardless of the actual form of the functional relationship in Eq. (1-29).
If the no-slip condition holds, the velocity profile varies from zero at the
lower wall to Vat the upper wall (Prob. 1-16 considers the case of a slip
boundary condition). Repeated experiments with various values of τ xy will
establish the functional relationship Eq. (1-29). For simple fluids such as
water, oils, or gases, the relationship is linear or newtonian:</p>

<img src="assets/images/1-291.png"/>

<p>or</p>

<img src="assets/images/1-292.png"/>

<p>The quantity μ, called the coefficient of viscosity of a newtonian fluid, is
what handbooks commonly quote when listing the viscosity of a fluid (see
App. A). Actually, there is also a second coefficient, λ, related to bulk fluid
expansions, but it is rarely encountered in practice (see Sec. 2-4). Equation
(1-30) shows that the dimensions of μ are stress-time: N•s/m2 [or kg/(m•s)]
in metric units and lbf•s/ft2 [or slugs/ft•s)] in English units. The conversion
factor is</p>

<img src="assets/images/1-30.png"/>

<p>The coefficient μ is a thermodynamic property and varies with temperature
and pressure. Data for common fluids are given in App. A.</p>

<h3>1-3.6 Viscosity as a Function of Temperature and Pressure</h3>

<p>The coefficient of viscosity of a newtonian fluid is directly related to molecular
interactions and thus may be considered a thermodynamic property in
the macroscopic sense, varying with temperature and pressure. The theory
of the transport properties of gases and liquids is still being developed, and
a comprehensive review is given by Hirschfelder et al. (1954). Extensive
data on properties of fluids are given by Reid et al. (1987).
No single functional relation μ(T, p) really describes</p>

<p>The curve labeled pseudoplastic in Fig. 1-16 is said to be shear-thinning, 
since its slope (local viscosity) decreases with increasing stress. If the thin- 
ning effect is very strong, the fluid may be termed plastic, as shown. The 
opposite case of a shear-thickening fluid is usually called a dilatant fluid, as 
shown.</p>

<p>Also illustrated in Fig. 1-16 is a material with a finite yield stress,
followed by a linear curve at finite strain rate. This idealized material, part
solid and part fluid, is called a Bingham plastic and is commonly used in
analytic investigations of yielding materials under flow conditions. Yielding
substances need not be linear but may show either dilatant or pseudoplastic
behavior</p>

<p>No single functional relation μ(T, p) really describes any large
class of fluids, but reasonable accuracy (±20 percent) can be achieved by
nondimensionalizing the data with respect to the critical point (Tc, Pc). This
procedure is the so-called principle of corresponding states [Keenan
(1941)], wherein the given property, here μ/ μe, is found to be roughly a
function of T/Tc and PilΡc, the reduced temperature and pressure.
This principle is not justified on thermodynamic grounds but arises simply
from dimensional analysis and experimental observation. Since changes
occur very rapidly near the critical point, Tc and Pc are known only approximately,
and it is essentially impossible to measure μc accurately. Appendix
A contains a table of critical constants (Tc, Pc, μc, kc) for common fluids,
which should be regarded as best-fit values.</p>

<p>This principle is not justi√î¬®√Öed on thermodynamic grounds but arises simply 
from dimensional analysis and experimental observation. Since changes 
occur very rapidly near the critical point, Tc and Pc are known only approxi- 
mately, and it is essentially impossible to measure ¬¨¬µc accurately. Appendix 
A contains a table of critical constants (Tc, Pc, ¬¨¬µc, kc) for common √î¬®√áuids, 
which should be regarded as best-√î¬®√Öt values. </p>

<p>Figure 1-17 shows a recommended correlation of reduced viscosity
μ/ μc vs. reduced temperature T/Tc and reduced pressure p/Pc' As
stated, the accuracy for any given fluid is about ±20 percent. By examining
this figure, we can make the following general statements:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The viscosity of liquids decreases rapidly with temperature.</li> 
	<li>The viscosity of low-pressure (dilute) gases increases with temperature. </li>
	<li>The viscosity always increases with pressure. </li>
	<li>Very poor accuracy obtains near the critical point.</li>
</ol> 

<p>Since Pc for most fluids is greater than 10 atm (App. A), typical gas flow
problems are at low reduced pressure and approximate the low-densitylimit
curve of Fig. 1-17.</p>
